  "description": "Most scoia'tael&nbsp;members have at one point or another been assigned as scouts for a commando, which means most scoia'tael scouts are generally more junior members of the organization, and generally younger. They are trained in both close and long range combat, and they emphasize retreat and caution over heroics. All scoia'tael members are trained to have a vial of poison at hand, to enhance their attacks and to have more opportunities if they were to get captured.",
