You create one of the following magical effects within range:<br><br>* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.<br><br>* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.<br>* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.<br>* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.<br>* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.<br>* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.<br><br>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",
