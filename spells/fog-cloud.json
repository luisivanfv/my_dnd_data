It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.<br><br><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.",
